# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a basic rock paper scissors game project. In future versions, it will have a better user interface. Instead of using nested if statements, I used a truth table lookup using a object, so it should be pretty fast relative to if statements or maps. Speed greatly depends on browser though [according to this stack overflow answer that compared maps to objects](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37994079)
